# COSI Data Challenge 2 (2024)

Welcome to the second COSI data challenge (DC2)! These data challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the upcoming launch of the COSI Small Explorer mission in 2027 ([Tomsick+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230812362T/abstract)). The main goals of the data challenges are to facilitate the development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools, and to provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data. The first data challenge (DC1) was released in March 2023, and it can be found [here](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-1). DC1 was focused on the 2016 COSI balloon flight ([Kierans+17](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170105558K/abstract)). It includes a general introduction into the Compton data space and analysis of Compton data, and so if you are unfamiliar with these topics, please take a look at DC1 for more background. The focus of DC2 is the satallite mission. With this data challenge we also make the first (alpha) release of our official high-level analysis tools, cosipy. 

## Installation Instructions:
DC2 requires cosipy. For a general introduction into cosipy see here. Installation instructions are given below:

1. Create a new conda environment (optional but highly encouraged).
  
2. Clone the repository into your local machine

```
git clone git@github.com:cositools/cosipy.git
```

3. Move to the cosipy folder

```
cd cosipy
```

4. Install:

```
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Help
Please submit a New Issue in git if you have issues with the code. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead, Chris Karwin ([christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov)) and/or the cosipy implementation lead, Israel Martinez-Castellanos ([israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov](israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov)).
