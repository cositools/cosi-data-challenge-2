# COSI Data Challenge 2 (2024)

Welcome to the second COSI data challenge (DC2)! These data challenges are released on a yearly basis in preparation for the upcoming launch of the COSI Small Explorer mission in 2027 ([Tomsick+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230812362T/abstract)). The main goals of the data challenges are to facilitate the development of the COSI data pipeline and analysis tools, and to provide resources to the astrophysics community to become familiar with COSI data. The first data challenge ([DC1](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-1)) was released in March 2023, and it was focused on data from the 2016 COSI balloon flight ([Kierans+17](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170105558K/abstract)). The focus of DC2 is the satallite mission. With this data challenge we also make the first (alpha) release of our official high-level analysis tools, cosipy. 

## Getting Started 
DC2 requires cosipy. A general introduction into cosipy, including installation instructions, can be found in the [cosipy_intro](https://github.com/cositools/cosi-data-challenge-2/tree/main/cosipy) directory.

The input models and challenges for DC2 were provided by the COSI science team. There are challenges for the different groups: Nucleosynthesis, Positron, GRB, Galactic, and Extragalactic. These are described in detail in the **Data Challenges** section below. We have created example jupyter notebooks demonstrating the basic tools that you'll need to complete each challenge. In addition to the main data challenges, we have given some extra challenges, which entails developing new functionality using the available tools in cosipy, e.g. methods for calculating light curves, SEDs, etc. Finally, we have also given some advanced challenges, which will require developing new tools. 

## Getting Help
Please submit a New Issue in git if you have issues with the code. If you have general feedback, or need further assistance, please reach out to the COSI Data Challenge team lead, Chris Karwin ([christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov](mailto:christopher.m.karwin@nasa.gov)) and/or the cosipy implementation lead, Israel Martinez-Castellanos ([israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov](israel.martinezcastellanos@nasa.gov)).
